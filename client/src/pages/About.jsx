      About Bjorn Estate
    </h1>
    <p className="text-slate-700">
      One thing all these website designs have in mind is that they give their services human faces.
      When you’re greeted by a warm smile, like the realtor in the ReMax web design above,
      instead of a bunch of buildings or stats, it’s easier to build a relationship with a brand from
      the moment you log on. This design keeps the friendly feeling throughout the website with icons
      that make the interaction feel casual, like a thumbs up reminiscent of Facebook’s Like button.

      When you buy a home, you don’t just move into the house—you move into its neighborhood.
      Real estate companies that work in highly desirable places can capitalize on this by showcasing
      the locales on their websites. This kind of design tends to feature big, crisp header photos that
      persuade the potential buyer to move into (or even spend a weekend in) the area.

      Although any kind of real estate website can benefit from humanizing design, brands that work
      with clients going through emotionally charged transactions, like downsizing empty nesters and
      young families buying the homes where their children will grow up, get the most mileage out of
      this type of website.
